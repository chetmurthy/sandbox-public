thrift-nicejson: Building Other Languages
================================================
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble

This library provides a "nice" JSON wire-protocol for Thrift. That means
you can define data-types/messages in Thrift, turn a crank, and get out
de/marshallers and a protocol stack that talk all of Thrift's protocols,
and also talk _idiomatic_ JSON.

For example, the (comes with) Thrift Calculator tutorial example has an
`i32 add(1:i32 num1, 2:i32 num2)` method, which the client invokes as
`add(1, 1)`. With this library, you can do that with POST:

....
% POST -c 'application/x-thrift' http://localhost:9090/
Please enter content (application/x-thrift) to be POSTed:
{"body":{"num1":1,"num2":1},"name":"add","seqid":0,"type":"call"}
<EOF>
....
